## Usage.
Create folder "models" in "retrieval" folder, and "thumb_images" in "static/" folder.
Get the pretrained CNN model from [this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TG_Fq_UryffsmV045u4MJGaWB-MJqNgI)
and put the model in path "./retrieval/models/".

run the following command:

```
$ python image_retrieval_cnn.py
```

# File orgnization.
If you only want to test the retrieval proccess, just read the code image_retrieval_cnn.py for reference.
